# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This houses a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic disaster. The model is built using Python and with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Overview
The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 was a tragic event that claimed many lives. This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset and create a predictive model to estimate the survival probability of passengers based on various features like age, gender, class, etc.

## Key Components
- **Data Handling:** Utilizing Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for graphical analysis and visualization of patterns and relationships within the dataset.
- **Model Development:** Employing Logistic Regression from scikit-learn to build and train the predictive model.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and accuracy using scikit-learn's `accuracy_score`.

## Files Included
- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset used for analysis and training.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git`
2. Install necessary libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and execute the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`
